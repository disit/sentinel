1) turn off all sentinel containers besides the db
2) compare the schema of the old db with the schema of the latest db and make it so the old one matches, including the collations (or fk won't work)
2.a) some default values of the database may need adjusted values
3) check for envirnoment variables to be added to the old configuration
4) delete old containers data (or the first few minutes after sentinel reboot may throw some notifications)
5) restart pods with newest images
